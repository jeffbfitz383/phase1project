# ðŸ“– Programming Book Viewer

### A simple, single-page website written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that allows users to select a Programming Book to view detailed info & leave a comment on our graffiti/comment wall!

This project was created by Barrett Kowalsky & Jeff Fitzpatrick as a part of our Phase 1 project for Flatiron School in Denver, CO. You can find the requirements for this project here: https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-javascript-project-mode

During this project, we learned how to fetch data from an API (in this case, we used <a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books">OpenLibrary's books API</a>). We also learned that it's not only possible to make a fetch request within another fetch request, but can also be necessary! In order to simplify & streamline these requests (we wanted 6 books to appear on the page). Below you can find instructions on how to get JSON server running in order to get comment functionality to work.

### Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open the folder in VS Code (or your preferred IDE).
3. In the terminal, run json-server --watch db.json
4. Open the index.html file in your browser and watch the magic happen.
